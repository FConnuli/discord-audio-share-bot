# discord-mic-bot

Discord bot to connect to your microphoneâ€•and you can have stereo sound

## Description

Discord transmits only mono sound to voice channel, which makes it a bad
experience if you want to sing karaoke or play an instrument in a voice party.
However, bot can transmit stereo sound to voice channel. Thus, you can connect
to your party channel as a bot.

## Installation

First, you need to install Python 3.7 or later version and download
discord-mic-bot.

Then, in terminal or command prompt, type:
```sh
cd /path/to/discord-mic-bot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

If on Linux, you also need to install libopus and libportaudio.

## Obtaining a bot token

You need to obtain a bot token to log into Discord's server.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on "New
   Application".

2. Inside the settings panel of your new application, click on "Bot".

3. Create a new bot. When asked about permissions, simply leaving blank is
   enough.

4. Click on "Copy Token".

5. Open the file named `token.txt` and paste your token inside that file.

## Inviting the bot to a Discord server

Note: You need to have the permission to invite a bot to the destination server.
If you don't have such a permission, the destination server **will not be
shown** in step 4. You can also ask an administrator who has such a permission
to help you invite your bot.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on your already
   created application.

2. Click on "Copy Client ID".

3. Go to
   ```
   https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&scope=bot
   ```
   (Replace `<CLIENT_ID>` with your Client ID)

4. Choose your destination server. Then click "Authorize".


## Usage

For Linux or macOS users, `discord-mic-bot` is the entry point.

For Windows users, `discord-mic-bot.cmd` is the entry point.

## Monitoring loudness

The loudness meter is compatible to EBU R 128 / ITU-R BS.1770, showing the
perceptible loudness for the last 0.4 seconds.

```
-70 ================================= -32 ============= -14 ==== -5 === 0 LUFS
 |                Blue                 |      Green      | Yellow | Red |
-70 ================================= -32 ============= -14 ==== -5 === 0 LUFS
```
* The left end is calibrated to -70 LUFS.
* Between blue and green is -32 LUFS.
* Between green and yellow is -14 LUFS.
* Between yellow and red is -5 LUFS.
* The right end is calibrated to 0 LUFS.

For music streaming, it is recommended to aim for -14 LUFS.

But if you are playing the background music while people are speaking, try to
lower down an extra 20 dB. **(i.e., aim for -34 LUFS.)**
